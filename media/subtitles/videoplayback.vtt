00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.580
This is the tale of two ancient cities and the trees that determined their destinies.

2
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.720
In 3000 BC. Uruk was more densely populated than modern-day New York City.

3
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.840
This crowded capital had to continually expand their irrigation system to feed its growing

4
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.580
population.

5
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.500
2.500 years later. in Sri Lanka. the city of Anura Dapura had a similar problem.

6
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.220
They were also growing constantly. and like Uruk. their city relied heavily on an elaborate irrigation system.

7
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.740
As Uruk grew. its farmers began chopping down trees to make space for more crops.

8
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.320
In Anura Dapura. however. trees were sacred.

9
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.440
Their city housed an offshoot of the Bodhi tree. under which Buddha himself was said to have

10
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.980
attained enlightenment. Religious reverence slowed farmers' axes and even led the city to plant

11
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.420
additional trees in urban parks. Initially. Uruk's expansion worked well. but without trees to

12
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.380
filter their water supply. Uruk's irrigation system became contaminated. Evaporating water left

13
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.820
mineral deposits. which rendered the soil too salty for agriculture. Conversely.

14
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.620
Anura Dapura's irrigation system was designed to work in concert with the surrounding forest.

15
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.700
Their city eventually grew to more than twice Uruk's population. and today.

16
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.800
Anura Dapura still cares for a tree planted over 2.000 years ago.

17
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.580
We may think of nature as being unconnected to our urban spaces. but trees have always been

18
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.260
an essential part of successful cities. Trees act like a natural sponge. absorbing stormwater

19
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.360
runoff before releasing it back into the atmosphere. The webs of their roots protect against mudslides.

20
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.320
while allowing soil to retain water and filter out toxins. Roots help prevent floods.

21
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.440
while reducing the need for storm drains and water treatment plants. Their porous leaves purify

22
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.100
the air by trapping carbon and other pollutants. making them essential in the fight against climate

23
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.380
change. Humanity has been uncovering these arboreal benefits for centuries. but trees aren't just

24
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.260
crucial to the health of a city's infrastructure. They play a vital role in the health of its

25
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.560
citizens as well. In the 1870s. Manhattan had few trees outside the island's parks. Without

26
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.560
trees to provide shade. buildings absorbed up to 9 times more solar radiation during deadly summer

27
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.400
heat waves. Combined with the period's poor sanitation standards. the oppressive heat made the

28
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.420
city a breeding ground for bacteria like cholera. In modern-day Hong Kong. tall skyscrapers and

29
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.880
underground infrastructure make it difficult for trees to grow. This contributes to the city's

30
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.360
dangerously poor air quality. which can cause bronchitis and diminished lung function.

31
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.220
Trees affect our mental health as well. Research indicates that the presence of green foliage

32
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.520
increases attention spans and decreases stress levels. It's even been shown that hospital

33
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.140
patients with views of brick walls recover more slowly than those with views of trees.

34
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.860
Fortunately. many cities are full of views like this. and that's no accident. As early as the

35
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.900
18th century. city planners began to embrace the importance of urban trees. In 1733.

36
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.900
Colonel James Oglethorpe planned the city of Savannah. Georgia to ensure that no neighborhood

37
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.580
was more than a two-minute walk from a park. After World War II. Copenhagen directed all new

38
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.420
development along five arteries. each sandwiched between a park. This layout increased the city's

39
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.760
resilience to pollution and natural disasters. and urban trees don't just benefit people.

40
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.160
Portland's Forest Park preserves the region's natural biodiversity. making the city home to various

41
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:18.960
local plants. 112 bird species. and 62 species of mammals. No city is more committed to trees than

42
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:27.240
Singapore. Since 1967. Singapore's government has planted over 1.2 million trees. including those

43
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.080
within 50-meter tall vertical gardens called super trees. These structures sustain themselves

44
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.180
and nearby conservatories with solar energy and collected rainwater. Trees and vegetation

45
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.020
currently cover over 50% of Singapore's landmass. reducing the need for air conditioning.

46
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:53.720
and encouraging low pollution transportation. By 2050. it's estimated that over 65% of the world

47
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.740
will be living in cities. City planners can play an eco-friendly foundation. but it's up to the

48
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.580
people who live in these urban forests to make them homes for more than humans.

49
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.380
The time to get involved with the climate movement is now. Don't know where to start? We've

50
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.920
partnered with the UN to create a 30-day challenge designed to teach you everything you need to know

51
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.380
to become a part of the solution. Start the challenge with a friend or family member today.
